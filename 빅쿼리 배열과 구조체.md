## 1. 배열과 구조체 개념

### 1.1 배열(ARRAY)이란?

**배열**은 동일한 타입의 값들을 순서대로 저장하는 데이터 구조입니다.

```sql
-- 기본 배열 생성
SELECT 
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] as numbers,
  ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'] as fruits,
  [DATE '2024-01-01', DATE '2024-01-02'] as dates;
```

### 1.2 구조체(STRUCT)란?

**구조체**는 서로 다른 타입의 필드들을 가진 복합 데이터 타입입니다.

```sql
-- 기본 구조체 생성
SELECT 
  STRUCT('John' as name, 25 as age, 'Engineer' as job) as person,
  STRUCT(
    'Product A' as name,
    100.0 as price,
    ['electronics', 'gadget'] as categories
  ) as product;
```

### 1.3 중첩 구조의 장점

```sql
-- 관계형 모델 (정규화)
-- customers 테이블
-- customer_id | name | email
-- orders 테이블  
-- order_id | customer_id | amount
-- order_items 테이블
-- item_id | order_id | product | quantity

-- BigQuery 중첩 모델 (비정규화)
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  customer_info.name,
  customer_info.email,
  orders -- 배열
FROM customer_orders_nested
WHERE customer_id = 123;
```

---

## 2. 배열 기본 사용법

### 2.1 배열 생성

```sql
-- 리터럴로 배열 생성
SELECT 
  [1, 2, 3] as simple_array,
  ['a', 'b', 'c'] as string_array,
  [true, false, true] as bool_array;

-- 쿼리 결과로 배열 생성
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  ARRAY_AGG(product_name) as purchased_products,
  ARRAY_AGG(order_amount) as order_amounts
FROM orders 
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- 조건부 배열 생성
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  ARRAY_AGG(product_name ORDER BY order_date DESC LIMIT 5) as recent_products
FROM orders 
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

### 2.2 배열 접근

```sql
-- 인덱스로 접근 (0부터 시작)
WITH sample_data AS (
  SELECT ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date'] as fruits
)
SELECT 
  fruits,
  fruits[OFFSET(0)] as first_fruit,      -- 'apple'
  fruits[OFFSET(1)] as second_fruit,     -- 'banana'
  fruits[SAFE_OFFSET(10)] as safe_access -- NULL (안전한 접근)
FROM sample_data;

-- ORDINAL 사용 (1부터 시작)
SELECT 
  fruits,
  fruits[ORDINAL(1)] as first_fruit,     -- 'apple'
  fruits[ORDINAL(2)] as second_fruit     -- 'banana'
FROM (SELECT ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'] as fruits);
```

### 2.3 배열 조건부 접근

```sql
-- 조건에 맞는 배열 요소 처리
WITH user_scores AS (
  SELECT 
    'user1' as user_id,
    [85, 92, 78, 96, 88] as test_scores
)
SELECT 
  user_id,
  test_scores,
  
-- 특정 점수 이상 개수
  (SELECT COUNT(*) 
   FROM UNNEST(test_scores) as score 
   WHERE score >= 90) as high_scores_count,
   
-- 최고점과 최저점
  (SELECT MAX(score) FROM UNNEST(test_scores) as score) as max_score,
  (SELECT MIN(score) FROM UNNEST(test_scores) as score) as min_score
FROM user_scores;
```

## 3. 구조체 기본 사용법

### 3.1 구조체 생성

```sql
-- 기본 구조체 생성
SELECT 
  STRUCT(
    'John Doe' as full_name,
    30 as age,
    'john@email.com' as email,
    ['reading', 'swimming'] as hobbies
  ) as user_profile;

-- 테이블에서 구조체 생성
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  STRUCT(
    first_name,
    last_name,
    email,
    phone
  ) as contact_info
FROM customers;
```

### 3.2 구조체 접근

```sql
-- 도트 표기법으로 접근
WITH user_data AS (
  SELECT STRUCT(
    'Alice' as name,
    28 as age,
    STRUCT(
      '123 Main St' as street,
      'New York' as city,
      'NY' as state
    ) as address
  ) as user_info
)
SELECT 
  user_info.name,                    -- 'Alice'
  user_info.age,                     -- 28
  user_info.address.street,          -- '123 Main St'
  user_info.address.city             -- 'New York'
FROM user_data;
```

### 3.3 구조체 배열

```sql
-- 구조체의 배열
WITH order_data AS (
  SELECT 
    'ORDER123' as order_id,
    [
      STRUCT('Product A' as name, 2 as quantity, 29.99 as price),
      STRUCT('Product B' as name, 1 as quantity, 49.99 as price),
      STRUCT('Product C' as name, 3 as quantity, 19.99 as price)
    ] as items
)
SELECT 
  order_id,
  items,
  
-- 총 아이템 수
  ARRAY_LENGTH(items) as total_items,
  
-- 총 주문 금액
  (SELECT SUM(item.quantity * item.price) 
   FROM UNNEST(items) as item) as total_amount
FROM order_data;
```

      STRUCT(
        '123 Oak Street' as street,
        'San Francisco' as city,
        'CA' as state,
        '94102' as zipcode
      ) as shipping_address
    ) as customer_info,
    [
      STRUCT(
        'ORD001' as order_id,
        DATE '2024-01-15' as order_date,
        [
          STRUCT('Laptop' as product, 1 as qty, 999.99 as price),
          STRUCT('Mouse' as product, 2 as qty, 25.00 as price)
        ] as items,
        STRUCT(
          49.99 as subtotal_discount,

    'user2' as user_id,
    ['orange', 'grape'] as fruits
)
SELECT 
  user_id,
  fruit
FROM sample_data,
UNNEST(fruits) as fruit;

-- 결과:
-- user1 | apple
-- user1 | banana  
-- user1 | cherry
-- user2 | orange
-- user2 | grape
```

### 7.2 UNNEST WITH OFFSET

```sql
-- 배열 인덱스와 함께 사용

  item_position + 1 as item_number
FROM sample_data,
UNNEST(items) as item_value WITH OFFSET as item_position
ORDER BY item_position;
```

### 7.3 복잡한 UNNEST 패턴

```sql
-- 구조체 배열의 UNNEST
WITH order_data AS (
  SELECT 
    'ORDER123' as order_id,
    DATE '2024-01-15' as order_date,
    [
      STRUCT('Product A' as name, 2 as quantity, 29.99 as unit_price),
      STRUCT('Product B' as name, 1 as quantity, 49.99 as unit_price),
      STRUCT('Product C' as name, 3 as quantity, 19.99 as unit_price)
    ] as items

SELECT 
  order_id,
  order_date,
  item.name as product_name,
  item.quantity,
  item.unit_price,
  item.quantity * item.unit_price as line_total,

## 9. 성능 최적화

### 9.1 배열 크기 제한

```sql
-- ❌ 비효율적: 무제한 배열 집계
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  ARRAY_AGG(order_id) as all_orders  -- 수천 개 주문이 있을 수 있음
FROM orders 
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- ✅ 효율적: 크기 제한
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  ARRAY_AGG(order_id ORDER BY order_date DESC LIMIT 10) as recent_orders
FROM orders 
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

### 9.2 적절한 필터링

```sql
-- ❌ 비효율적: 전체 배열 처리 후 필터링
WITH all_data AS (
  SELECT 
    user_id,
    ARRAY_AGG(
      STRUCT(event_type, event_time, event_data)
    ) as all_events
  FROM events
  GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT 
  user_id,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM UNNEST(all_events) as e WHERE e.event_type = 'purchase') as purchases
FROM all_data;

-- ✅ 효율적: 미리 필터링
SELECT 
  user_id,
  ARRAY_AGG(
    STRUCT(event_type, event_time, event_data)
  ) as purchase_events
FROM events
WHERE event_type = 'purchase'  -- 미리 필터링
GROUP BY user_id;
```

### 9.3 중첩 구조 최적화

```sql
-- 파티션된 테이블에서 배열 처리 최적화
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  order_date,
  ARRAY_AGG(
    STRUCT(product_id, quantity, price)
    ORDER BY price DESC
  ) as order_items
FROM orders_partitioned
WHERE order_date = CURRENT_DATE()  -- 파티션 프루닝
GROUP BY customer_id, order_date
HAVING COUNT(*) <= 50;  -- 대용량 주문 제외
```

## 10. 모범 사례와 주의점

### 10.1 모범 사례

#### 1. 적절한 배열 크기 유지
```sql
-- ✅ 좋은 예: 크기 제한과 정렬
SELECT 
  product_id,
  ARRAY_AGG(
    STRUCT(user_id, rating, review_text)
    ORDER BY rating DESC, review_date DESC
    LIMIT 20  -- 최대 20개 리뷰만
  ) as top_reviews
FROM product_reviews
WHERE rating >= 4  -- 고평점만
GROUP BY product_id;
```

#### 2. 명확한 구조체 필드 이름
```sql
-- ✅ 좋은 예: 명확한 필드명
SELECT 
  STRUCT(
    first_name as given_name,
    last_name as family_name,
    birth_date as date_of_birth,
    phone_number as primary_phone
  ) as contact_details
FROM users;
```

#### 3. 적절한 중첩 레벨
```sql
-- ✅ 좋은 예: 2-3 레벨 중첩
SELECT 
  user_id,
  STRUCT(
    personal_info.name,
    personal_info.email,
    preferences.categories  -- 배열
  ) as user_summary
FROM user_profiles;

-- ❌ 피해야 할 예: 과도한 중첩
-- STRUCT(STRUCT(STRUCT(...))) - 5+ 레벨
```

### 10.2 주의점

#### 1. NULL 처리
```sql
-- NULL 안전 배열 처리
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  ARRAY_AGG(
    CASE 
      WHEN order_amount IS NOT NULL THEN order_amount 
    END 
    IGNORE NULLS
  ) as valid_order_amounts
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

#### 2. 배열 순서 보장
```sql
-- ❌ 잘못된 예: 순서 보장 없음
SELECT 
  ARRAY_AGG(product_name) as products
FROM products;

-- ✅ 올바른 예: 명시적 정렬
SELECT 
  ARRAY_AGG(product_name ORDER BY product_name) as products_alphabetical,
  ARRAY_AGG(product_name ORDER BY popularity DESC) as products_by_popularity
FROM products;
```

#### 3. 타입 일관성
```sql
-- ❌ 잘못된 예: 타입 불일치
SELECT [1, '2', 3.0] as mixed_array;  -- 오류 발생

-- ✅ 올바른 예: 일관된 타입
SELECT [CAST(1 AS STRING), '2', CAST(3.0 AS STRING)] as string_array;
```

#### 4. 메모리 사용량 고려
```sql
-- 큰 배열 처리 시 주의
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  -- 대용량 데이터의 경우 샘플링 고려
  ARRAY_AGG(
    order_details ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 100  -- 랜덤 샘플링
  ) as sample_orders
FROM large_orders_table
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

### 10.3 디버깅 팁

```sql
-- 배열/구조체 구조 확인
WITH debug_data AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    ARRAY_AGG(
      STRUCT(order_id, order_date, total_amount)
      ORDER BY order_date DESC
    ) as orders
  FROM orders 
  GROUP BY customer_id
  LIMIT 1
)
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  ARRAY_LENGTH(orders) as order_count,
  orders[OFFSET(0)] as first_order,  -- 첫 번째 주문 구조 확인
  TO_JSON_STRING(orders[OFFSET(0)]) as first_order_json  -- JSON으로 구조 확인
FROM debug_data;
```
