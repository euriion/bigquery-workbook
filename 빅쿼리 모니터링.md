## 1. 모니터링 개요

### 1.1 모니터링 데이터 소스

BigQuery는 다양한 메타데이터 뷰를 제공합니다:

```sql
-- 주요 모니터링 테이블들
SELECT table_name, table_type 
FROM `project.region-us.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`
WHERE table_schema = 'INFORMATION_SCHEMA'
  AND table_name LIKE '%JOB%'
ORDER BY table_name;

-- 결과:
-- JOBS_BY_PROJECT
-- JOBS_BY_USER  
-- JOBS_BY_ORGANIZATION
-- JOB_TIMELINE_BY_PROJECT
-- JOB_TIMELINE_BY_USER
```

### 1.2 기본 모니터링 쿼리

```sql
-- 일일 BigQuery 사용 현황 요약
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `project.monitoring.daily_usage_summary` AS
SELECT 
  DATE(creation_time) as usage_date,
  user_email,
  project_id,
  
  -- 쿼리 통계
  COUNT(*) as total_queries,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN state = 'DONE' AND error_result IS NULL THEN 1 END) as successful_queries,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN error_result IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as failed_queries,
  
  -- 성능 메트릭
  ROUND(AVG(TIMESTAMP_DIFF(end_time, start_time, SECOND)), 2) as avg_duration_seconds,
  ROUND(MAX(TIMESTAMP_DIFF(end_time, start_time, SECOND)), 2) as max_duration_seconds,
  
  -- 리소스 사용량
  ROUND(SUM(total_bytes_processed) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024, 2) as total_gb_processed,
  ROUND(SUM(total_slot_ms) / 1000 / 60 / 60, 2) as total_slot_hours,
  
  -- 비용 추정 (스캔 비용 기준)
  ROUND(SUM(total_bytes_processed) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 * 5, 2) as estimated_scan_cost_usd
  
FROM `project.region-us.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT`
WHERE DATE(creation_time) >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
  AND job_type = 'QUERY'
GROUP BY DATE(creation_time), user_email, project_id
ORDER BY usage_date DESC, total_gb_processed DESC;
```

## 2. 쿼리 성능 모니터링

### 2.1 느린 쿼리 감지

```sql
-- 성능이 좋지 않은 쿼리 식별

    total_slot_ms / 1000 / 60 as slot_minutes,
    
    -- 효율성 지표

  FROM `project.region-us.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT`
  WHERE DATE(creation_time) >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 DAY)
    AND job_type = 'QUERY'
    AND state = 'DONE'
    AND error_result IS NULL
    AND TIMESTAMP_DIFF(end_time, start_time, SECOND) > 60  -- 1분 이상 실행
)
SELECT 
  job_id,
  user_email,
  SUBSTR(query, 1, 100) as query_preview,
  duration_seconds,
  gb_processed,
  slot_minutes,
  
  -- 성능 등급
  CASE 
    WHEN duration_seconds > 3600 THEN 'Critical (>1hr)'
    WHEN duration_seconds > 1800 THEN 'High (>30min)' 
    WHEN duration_seconds > 600 THEN 'Medium (>10min)'
    ELSE 'Low (1-10min)'
  END as performance_issue_level,
  
  -- 최적화 제안
  CASE 
    WHEN bytes_per_slot_ms < 1000 THEN 'Consider query optimization - low bytes per slot'
    WHEN gb_processed > 100 THEN 'Large scan - consider partitioning or clustering'
    WHEN join_count > 5 THEN 'Complex joins - review join order and conditions'
    WHEN select_count > 3 THEN 'Multiple subqueries - consider CTEs or temp tables'
    ELSE 'Review for other optimization opportunities'
  END as optimization_suggestion
  
FROM slow_queries
ORDER BY duration_seconds DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### 2.2 쿼리 패턴 분석

    (LENGTH(query) - LENGTH(REPLACE(UPPER(query), 'GROUP BY', ''))) / 8 as groupby_count,
    (LENGTH(query) - LENGTH(REPLACE(UPPER(query), 'ORDER BY', ''))) / 8 as orderby_count
    
  FROM `project.region-us.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT`
  WHERE DATE(creation_time) >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
    AND job_type = 'QUERY'
    AND state = 'DONE'
    AND error_result IS NULL
)
SELECT 
  query_pattern,
  COUNT(*) as query_count,
  ROUND(AVG(duration_seconds), 2) as avg_duration,
  ROUND(AVG(gb_processed), 2) as avg_gb_processed,
  ROUND(AVG(join_count), 1) as avg_joins,
  
  -- 성능 지표
  ROUND(PERCENTILE_CONT(duration_seconds, 0.5) OVER(PARTITION BY query_pattern), 2) as median_duration,
  ROUND(PERCENTILE_CONT(duration_seconds, 0.95) OVER(PARTITION BY query_pattern), 2) as p95_duration,
  
  -- 최적화 우선순위
